This is a package for remote control of a botball unit..

INSTALLATION

Go in to the build folder and run make, it will generate the command code and move the pertinent source files to the upload file.

Then, run remoteinstall.sh with the ipaddress of the robot (it must be on the same network, of course!) and it will load the files
to the robot and build the onboard library.
