BasicClient provides a TINY text interface to a server - in this case the robot..

Some basic commands you can type are

mtr [motor] [power]

mav [motor] [power]

mmr [motor1] [power1] [motor2] [power2]


JoystickClient provides control via a joystick. It assumes that the wheels are on motors 1 and 3, and the claw is connected to motor 0.
Yes, it's not very extensible or modifiable- it's simply not very good code. I made it in an afternoon as a proof of concept, development
was concentrated in the server and control library. Feel free to write your own client code (but I'd definitely like to see it if you
do end up making something!)
